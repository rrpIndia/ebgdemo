<h1>🗳️ Mock EVM + VVPAT Simulator (Browser-based)</h1>
<p>This project is a <strong>browser-based simulation of an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) with VVPAT</strong>, built using <strong>HTML, SVG, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript</strong>.</p>
<p>The goal is <strong>not UI polish</strong>, but to model <strong>correct voting logic, state transitions, and VVPAT behavior</strong> as realistically as possible.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🚀 Features</h2>
<h3>✅ EVM + Ballot Unit</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two candidates (🍎 Apple, 🍌 Banana)</li>
<li>Button press with LED feedback</li>
<li>Vote locking to prevent rapid double voting</li>
</ul>
<h3>✅ VVPAT Slip Simulation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Slip preview window</li>
<li>Slip movement into storage slots</li>
<li>SVG-based slip rendering (no canvas, no images)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🧠 Core Logic Design</h2>
<p>This project is intentionally designed as a <strong>state machine</strong>, not a simple animation demo.</p>
<h3>🔹 Phase 1 – Movement (Completed)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Slips move <strong>only</strong> when finalized</li>
<li>Preview position is explicit</li>
<li>Storage positions are fixed</li>
<li>No time-based movement hacks</li>
</ul>
<h3>🔹 Phase 2 – Visibility (Completed)</h3>
<p>Slip visibility depends on <strong>two independent light sources</strong>:</p>

<h3>🔹 Phase 3 – Voting Logic (Completed)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Only <strong>one preview slip</strong> exists at any time</li>
<li>Votes are grouped into <strong>runs</strong></li>
<li>Repeated votes trigger special behavior</li>
<li>Winner emission happens <strong>once per run</strong></li>
<li>Explicit run reset prevents phantom slips</li>
</ul>

<h2>🏆 Winner Logic (Experimental)</h2>
<ul>
<li>A fixed <code>winner</code> symbol (currently 🍌) is used for testing</li>
<li>On the <strong>second same vote in a run</strong>, the winner is emitted</li>
<li>Further identical votes start a <strong>new run</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This logic is intentionally explicit to explore edge cases.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🛑 Voting Limit</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maximum <strong>4 finalized votes</strong></li>
<li>After 4 votes:
<ul>
<li>Voting is locked</li>
<li>Voters are alerted</li>
<li>Results can be viewed by opening the lid</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>🧩 Important State Variables</h2>
<pre><code class="language-js">previewSlip           // unresolved slip at preview
voteLog               // finalized slips only

# 🗳️ Mock EVM + VVPAT Simulator

A **browser-based simulation of an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) with VVPAT**, built using **HTML, SVG, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.

🔗 **Live Demo (GitHub Pages):**  
➡️ https://&lt;your-username&gt;.github.io/&lt;your-repo-name&gt;/

&gt; This project focuses on **correct logic, state transitions, and VVPAT behavior**, not UI polish.

---

## 📸 Preview

Open the live demo and:
- Cast votes using the Ballot Unit
- Watch slips appear in the VVPAT preview
- Toggle the lid to inspect stored slips
- Observe correct behavior after voting ends

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Ballot Unit
- Two candidates (🍎 Apple, 🍌 Banana)
- Button press animation
- LED feedback
- Vote lock to prevent rapid re-votes

### ✅ VVPAT Slip Simulation
- SVG-based slips (no images, no canvas)
- Preview window


- Slip storage slots
- Smooth animated movement

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

This project is designed as a **finite-state system**, not a simple animation demo.

---

## 🔹 Phase 1 — Movement (Completed)
- Slips move **only** when finalized
- Preview position is explicit
- Storage positions are fixed
- No time-based movement hacks

---

## 🔹 Phase 2 — Visibility (Completed)

Slip visibility depends on **two light sources**:

| Condition | Visible Slips |
|--------|---------------|
Lid open | All slips |
Lid closed + artificial light (≤7s) | Preview slip only |
Lid closed + no light | No slips |

&gt; Artificial light stays ON for **7 seconds after each vote**

---

## 🔹 Phase 3 — Voting Logic (Completed)

- Only **one preview slip** exists at any time
- Votes are grouped into **runs**
- Repeated votes trigger special behavior
- Winner emission happens **once per run**
- Explicit run reset prevents phantom slips

---

## 🏆 Winner Logic (Experimental)

- A fixed `winner` symbol (🍌) is used for testing
- On the **second identical vote in a run**, the winner is emitted
- Further identical votes start a **new run**

This logic exists to explore **edge cases and state correctness**.

---

## 🛑 Voting Limit

- Maximum **4 finalized votes**
- After voting ends:
  - Buttons are ignored
  - Voter is alerted
  - Results can be viewed by opening the VVPAT lid

---

## 🧩 Key State Variables

```js
previewSlip           // unresolved slip at preview
voteLog               // finalized slips only
lastVoteSymbol        // tracks vote runs
winnerEmittedForRun   // prevents duplicate winners
artificialLightOn     // 7-second VVPAT light
vvpatOpen             // lid state (natural light)
⚠️ Preview slips are never stored in voteLog
🔒 Core Invariants
Preview slip is never inferred from storage
Storage layout never touches preview
Time never moves slips — only state transitions do
Winner is emitted at most once per run
All resets are explicit
